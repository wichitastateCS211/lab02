# More Loops
Using one of the loops we have covered, print the multiples of 13 in the range [13, 260]. Each number shall appear on its own line.

## Hints
- Counting variables don't have to only increment or decrement.

## Remember
- Name your file wsuid\_lab02.cpp
- You are now required to include a comment block at the top of the file. See the Coding Guidelines handout.
